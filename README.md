## Reflection

### 1️⃣ How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How do user stories help?  
I translate stakeholder feedback into **user stories** that describe desired outcomes in simple, testable language (“As a customer, I want X so that Y”). This process keeps the focus on business value rather than technical tasks. During backlog refinement, I clarify acceptance criteria and estimate story size, ensuring every sprint delivers measurable value. In the ChadaTech pilot, using well-defined stories reduced rework by 35% and improved on-time completion by 22%:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.

### 2️⃣ How do I approach developing programs? Which Agile processes will I carry forward?  
I follow **Scrum with DevOps integration**. Each sprint begins with planning and ends with a review and retrospective. Key habits I’ll keep:  
- Maintain a **Definition of Ready/Done** to guarantee clarity and quality.  
- Use **short iterations** for quick feedback and adaptability.  
- Track progress in a single ecosystem (Azure DevOps) for transparency.  
These practices produced measurable gains in predictability, velocity, and customer satisfaction during the project.

### 3️⃣ What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?  
Being a strong team member means **communicating early**, owning quality, and prioritizing team goals over individual pride. In Scrum, success depends on honesty during stand-ups, peer review, and retrospectives. I strive to be proactive about blockers, support teammates, and suggest small continuous-improvement experiments each sprint.
